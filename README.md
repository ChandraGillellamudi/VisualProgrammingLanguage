This project aims to create a node-based visual programming language that assembles to executable Swift code and can be written almost entirely using an Apple Pencil or touch.

A [video](Media/Short%20Demo.MP4) is also available of constructing a simple program.

## Discussion

I encourage you to try the playground and then try the standalone application. The playground explains many aspects of the VPL and shows you how to extend it.

This entire project was developed in around a week and – sadly – there is a limit to what I can do in a week. Because of that, there are many vital nodes that are missing that would be easy to add, especially pertaining to floating point math. **Pull requests are welcome.**

## Future Goals

I hope to continue development this summer. Hold tight!
